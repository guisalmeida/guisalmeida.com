Hi! I'm Guilherme, if you want to know more about me you can see [here](https://guisalmeida.com/about), you must be new here, so I decided to write my first post talking a little about my motivations for having a blog.

I still consider myself a beginner as a developer, until 2018 my professional career was always as a designer working on projects such as book layout, visual communication, agency marketing and freelance creation of stationery and visual identity.

With this I intend to share the knowledge that I have been acquiring as a way to validate, memorize and help other beginners who are going through the same problems and doubts.

I intend to post web development tips mainly, a little theory about what I've been studying in the computer science course, technology book reviews, events, courses and whatever else comes to mind.

So that's it, feel free, get a cup of coffee and wait for new posts so we can exchange ideas about the technology world.
