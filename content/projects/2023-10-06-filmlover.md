## Intro

**FilmLover** is a ReactJS application for users engaging with movies by swiping to like or dislike. Users are able to see the movies they like/dislike and search for movies. Think about Tinder for movies.

Implemented the project architecture using Vite, React, Redux Toolkit, React Router, Styled Components, and Axios.  
Used React Persist lib to save in the local storage movies that the user likes or dislikes.
Used the API themoviedb.org to show movies.
